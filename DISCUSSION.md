Given more time, these are some of the improvements I would make:

- Add unit tests
- Add error handling
- Add loading states
- Add pagination to the advocates list
- Improve styling and responsiveness

I think there is a discussion to be had about the purpose of the list of advocates. If it is simply to view the list, then the current implementation is sufficient. However, if the purpose is to select an advocate to view more details or perform actions, then I would suggest making each advocate item clickable and navigating to a detailed view page.

If this table were intended to be added inside of an existing application, I would suggest making the following improvements:
- Integrate with the existing styling and theming of the application
- Ensure that the table is responsive and works well on different screen sizes
- Add functionality to sort and filter the list of advocates that is more advanced than just a search bar
- Ensure that the table is accessible and follows best practices for accessibility

I did not have time to set up a database, so I used the static array of advocate data. If I had more time, I would set up a database and fetch the data from there. I would also add functionality to add, edit, and delete advocates from the list. Pagination would also be a good addition if the list of advocates were to grow large.
